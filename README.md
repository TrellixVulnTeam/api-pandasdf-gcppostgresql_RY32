##ASSUMPTIONS
#Intraday losses greater than 20% are unlikely to be a market failure
# and are more probably a single stock failure
# 

#function that compares the current search average to the averages
#of the periods say 2-6 months before and after the stock drops
#as a normalized value

#or i could compute the running average or search activity over the last 3-6months 
#and compare that to the current value, and then add the normalised value to 
#the average and compute the next value

#FINDLOCATIONS OF NEGATIVE GRADIENT
# starts at zero and searches finds the max and min of the adjacent 20%
# for max and min and creates gradient, saves locations to object, and then moves onto
# next value and saves gradient etc until finish
# searches object and eliminates similar entries or upgrades a min or max 
# point if it creates a more significant gradient or a larger pecentage
